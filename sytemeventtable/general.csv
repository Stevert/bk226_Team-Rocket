Alert Class,Reason,Response to initiate
Critical,Pump Malfunction,"1. Verify the pump's operating pressure.
2. If pressure is over safe range,reduce pump voltage to decrease the pressure.
3.If pressure is below safe range, check the tank level and refill the tank if needed. 
4. Perform a thorough pump test as soon as pipeline stabilizes."
,Pump may trip,"1.  Slow reduce the pump voltage to control pressure. 
2. Losen the valves to prevent pressure increase.
3. Conitnuously monitor the condition at all stations.
4. Tighten the valves to maintain gas flow"
,Pump Tripped,"1. Tighten the valves to prevent pressure loss.
2. Restart the pump and gradually increase its pressure. 
3. Release the valve when system stabilizes "
,Low pump operation,"1. Check the throughput into the system. 
2. If throughput is very high, then dismiss the alert.
3. If throughput is very low, gradually increase the pump pressure."
Alert,Low output flow,"1. Release valves to increase gas throughput.
2. Gradualy increase the pump pressure."
,High Pump pressure,"1. Reduce the pump voltage. 
2. Tighten the valves to maintain the flow."
,Pump restart,"1. Tighen the values to maitain pressure. 
2. Gradually increase pump voltage. 
3. When pump operates at normal range, release the valves."
,Low tank level,"1.Restart the pump and gradually increase input pressure
2.Gradually decrease pump voltage."
